AI_FINAL_TERM_PROJ_PRED_SHOPPING - Main File of project

Video - Videos folder
CaptureIt - Android Application(THis is not in the scope of the project, but since I added videos of it. Therefore, I have added it)
Machine Learning Model - COntains files which I worked with earlier and faced problems(ann_one, ...), 
also contains files of relative product prediction(ann_dependence, ...).


These videos are numbered start1,2,3,learningcurve, conclusion, I understand that these have a long duration but I had to 
explain every part of this.
Thankyou
